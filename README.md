== Description ==
This Go project creates a JSON API for retrieving flight schedule data. The API provides endpoints to access flight schedules, including details such as departure and arrival times, destinations, and prices. It is designed to be a backend service that can be integrated with frontend applications or other services that require flight schedule data.
